# Secret Santa backend

Backend for a Secret Santa app that allows people to join a raffle and on a set deadline shows them who they have to buy a present for.

## Supposed functionality

* participant identified by email address
* each participant is receiver of a gift from someone else (not himself)
* each participant is a giver of a gift (receiver does not know who the giver is)
* should have a deadline when the draw and emails are sent automatically
* maybe other features to come...
