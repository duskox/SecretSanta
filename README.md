# Secret Santa backend

Learning Node.js project and should provide backend functionality for a Secret Santa draw among a group of people.

## Supposed functionality

* participant identified by email address
* each participant is receiver of a gift from someone else (not himself)
* each participant is a giver of a gift (receiver does not know who the giver is)
* should have a deadline when the draw and emails are sent automatically
* maybe other features to come...
